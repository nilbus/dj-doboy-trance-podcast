Isaiah Institute Podcasts
=========================

Layout
------

- `_config.yml`: Site-wide configuration settings
- `*.xml`: Each podcast has its own XML file at the root level, which contains podcast-specific configuration.
- `_posts/`: Holds individual podcast episodes. Each subdirectory holds podcast expisode files. Episodes are assigned to each podcast by _tag_, not by virtue of the directory it resides in.
- `assets/`: Contains podcast images.
- `_includes/podcast.xml`: This template contains the structure for the podcast feed XML.
