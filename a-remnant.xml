The scriptures teach that the restoration of the Lost Tribes of Israel will rival the exodus of Egypt in both wonder and might. It will be an event so incredible, that kings will shut their mouths in astonishment when it occurs. It will shape the events of America, and the world, more than any of the peripheral signs and wonders most people associate with the Second Coming. If you do not understand the covenants that the Lord has made regarding the restoration of the House of Israel, you are not prepared for what is about to transpire upon the earth. Get ready for an amazing adventure, things are about to get very exciting!" album_art="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0458/6196/1889/products/ScreenShot2020-05-29at6.00.11PM_720x.png" podcast_category="Religion &amp; Spirituality" podcast_subcategory="Christianity" %}
